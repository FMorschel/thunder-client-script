# thunder-client-script

This project is for me to create a script template to be used with the  `Thunder Client`. Thunder Client is a REST API client extension for Visual Studio Code. It is a lightweight and fast client that is used to test RESTful APIs.

## Usage

The `full_script` file is meant to be copied and pasted into the `Thunder Client` editor. The `inner_html` file is meant to be just a helper to correctly colouring inside the IDE. It must be then placed inside the `full_script` html variable.

The `chart_data` variable inside the `inner_html` is given with the second value passed to `tc.chartHTML` inside `chart_data`.
